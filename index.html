       <p>Hello! I'm a born and raised Bay Area girly who loves to create and admire pretty things. I’ve been designing and photographing since I was 16 years old. I first fell in love with photography because the world around me was too interesting not to capture. Once I began editing in photoshop and illustrator, my photos were brought to the next level and I haven’t looked back since. That was my main drive to choose to attend San Francisco State University for my bachelors degree in Visual Communication Design.

        <p>Besides being a designer, I also love to be out with my partner and friends, going to the gym, reading fantasy books, letting time fly by at cafes or museums, and going on hikes anywhere I can. I feel inspired and driven the most when I'm outdoors because when I'm out and about I feel like I can finally take a deep breath and not have to worry of anything else. In those moments I feel like I can really appreciate eveyrthing that's happening behind the scenes in my day to day life and when I'm done with the hike or ready to leave the beach, I feel full and I try my best to continue to find activities that make me feel rejuvenated.</p>
