       <h1>My name is Sofia Garcia- Ortiz</h1>

       <p>Hello! I'm a born and raised Bay Area girly who loves to create and admire pretty things. I’ve been designing and photographing since I was 16 years old. I first fell in love with photography because the world around me was too interesting not to capture. Once I began editing in photoshop and illustrator, my photos were brought to the next level and I haven’t looked back since. That was my main drive to choose to attend San Francisco State University for my bachelors degree in Visual Communication Design.
        <br> 
        Besides being a designer, I also love to be out with my friends and partner, going to the gym, reading fantasy books, letting time fly by at cafes or museums, going on hikes around Mt. Tam, and baking sweet treats. I adore the Legion of Honor museum and SFMoMA because I sometimes find inspiration for life, and designs while I’m there. Someday I want to go back to New York and spend an entire day, or two, walking around the Metropolitan Museum with my boyfriend who grew up in New York. 
        <br>
        The next few tabs will be an accumulation of some of the work I completed while attending San Francisco State University. Hopefully you enjoy them!</p>
