        <h2>These are a Few Artists Who Inspire Me</h2>

        <h3><em>Guweiz</em></h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/guweiz/">Guweiz</a> is a digital artist who creates these fabulous world building designs focusing on two Japanese women who are assassins. 
                I admire his ability to create in depth scenarios that these women face throughout his drawings. His attention to detail is 
                another aspect of his art that I admire greatly because he thinks of it all.</p>

        <h3><em>The Marias</em></h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NOlqJHvAZo">The Maria's</a> are a band based in LA that makes latin indie pop music. Their last album Submarine was written together as a 
                band and it came out to be very emotional and vulnerable from varying points of view from each member. I admire their ability to write 
                music that speaks volumes and can relate to a lot of different people despite their backgrounds. The lead singer Maria inspires me to be more 
                creative and to live in the now, not 5 minutes ago, yesterday, or tomorrow, but now.</p>

        <h3><em>Vivienne Westwood</em></h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.viviennewestwood.com/en-us/home/?srsltid=AfmBOop5mRauiPYNENe7nAr5L6Ji0wl_T-L8J55b4Ta-hV3Qc-V33Qwt">Vivienne Westwood</a> is an iconic english designer who wasn't afraid to use loud colors or patterns in her designs. Her clothing lines
                would alwyas include dramatic silhouettes with a blend of wavy lines, and harsh strick geometrical lines. Whenever I'm doing a project that 
                I have to use more than a few basic colors on, I think of Vivienne's designs and how I can challenege color theory in a good way.</p>
